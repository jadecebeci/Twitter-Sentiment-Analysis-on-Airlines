## Business Understanding

Airline companies wants to use model to identify customers that are having a negative experience and direct tweets with negative sentiment towards the proper channel.

One way this might be accomplished would be to set up a bot that uses sentiment analysis to automatically identify tweets with negative sentiment, and then direct those tweets to the appropriate customer service representative or department for further assistance.

By implementing this system, the airline company can improve customer satisfaction by addressing negative experiences more quickly and efficiently, increase brand loyalty by showing that they value and take action on customer feedback.
